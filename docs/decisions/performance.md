# Decisions — Performance

## Resolution targets: 32³ baseline, 64³ first serious target, 128³ aspirational

**Decision** — A stable/interactable 32³ is the required floor; 64³ is the first
serious measured target and the current default; 128³ is aspirational and must not
drive the architecture. A smaller stable preset with measured justification is an
acceptable ship.

**Why** — 128³ is 2M+ cells before particles, solver, scalar, and mesh buffers.
Starting there builds an impressive target instead of a working app. Correct 32³
beats broken or unmeasured 64³.

**Tradeoffs** — 64³ looks modest until surface rendering and scenarios arrive, in
exchange for developing against real GPU constraints sooner.

**Applies to** — `architecture/simulation.md`, `architecture/gpu-resources.md`.

## Run exactly one preset until the human-facing pass; tiers are 1.5 work

**Decision** — Until the 1.5 scale/quality pass there is exactly one preset (whatever
runs). The low/default/high tier system is a 1.5 *output* set from measurements, not a
running concern.

**Why** — Tiers are only meaningful once measurements exist and a human is choosing.
Building a tier system earlier serves no consumer.

**Applies to** — `architecture/settings.md`, `architecture/gpu-resources.md`.

## Respect the per-stage storage-buffer limit — split passes, don't combine

**Decision** — The MAC loop is split into many small GPU passes, each binding only a
few storage buffers, rather than one mega-pass binding everything.

**Why** — `maxStorageBuffersPerShaderStage` is commonly only 8–10 on real adapters,
and the loop has many buffers (ping-ponged `u/v/w`, pressure ×2, divergence, cell
type, particle pos/vel, P2G sum/weight). A single combined pass would exceed the limit
and fail at pipeline creation — a classic "first GPU loop won't even build" failure.
This is a layout constraint, not an optimization.

**Code anchors** — `app/crates/fluid-lab/src/gpu/mod.rs → GpuCaps` (limit probe at boot);
`app/crates/fluid-lab/src/gpu/fluid.rs` (pass split).

**Applies to** — `architecture/gpu-resources.md`.

## Hot data is structure-of-arrays with fixed per-scene buffers and ping-pong

**Decision** — Hot simulation data uses structure-of-arrays layout, fixed-size
buffers per scene, and ping-pong buffers for iterative passes (pressure, scalar
fields). Avoid CPU/GPU readback during normal frames; keep debug readbacks throttled.

**Why** — SoA suits the GPU access pattern and avoids alignment traps from mirroring
arbitrary Rust structs into WGSL; fixed buffers avoid per-frame allocation; ping-pong
is the standard double-buffer for in-place iterative solves.

**Applies to** — `architecture/gpu-resources.md`, `architecture/simulation.md`.

## Rectangular-tank cost scales with nx·ny·nz; extreme aspect ratios are unaddressed

**Decision** — Cell counts are per-axis (`grid.res_x/y/z`, 16..128 each) at a fixed
uniform cell size, so per-frame work and buffer size scale with `nx·ny·nz`. The
SoA / pass-split layout above is unchanged — per-axis counts only change the buffer
extents, not the strategy. Extreme aspect ratios (very thin or very elongated tanks)
are a follow-up perf/quality concern: CFL and `FIXED_SCALE` were not re-tuned for them.

**Why** — Uniform `h` keeps the solver and buffer layout identical to the cube case;
only the dimensions differ, so the existing fixed-buffer / ping-pong rationale carries
over directly. Per-axis tuning of the timestep is deferred until extreme ratios matter.

**Code anchors** — `app/crates/fluid-lab/src/settings/mod.rs → grid.res_x/y/z`;
`app/crates/fluid-lab/src/sim/mod.rs → H`; `app/crates/fluid-lab/src/gpu/fluid.rs → FIXED_SCALE`.

**Revisit when** — extreme tank aspect ratios produce instability or visible quality loss.

**Applies to** — `architecture/gpu-resources.md`, `architecture/simulation.md`.

## Fixed-dt substep cap: default 1, drop excess, catch up by rendering the next frame

**Decision** — `physics.max_substeps` defaults to 1. Each rendered frame advances at most `max_substeps` fixed-dt substeps; if the natural substep count would exceed the cap, the remaining accumulated sim time is dropped entirely that frame (not carried forward) and recorded in cumulative `dropped_time`. The browser catches up by rendering the next frame, not by making one frame longer.

**Why** — A slow frame should stay cheap. A high cap allows unbounded catch-up: one hitch produces N× the normal per-frame work, compounding the overload and stalling interactivity. With the default of 1 the worst case per frame is exactly one fixed-dt substep, so frame time is predictable. The physics falls slightly behind under load but recovers immediately on the next frame.

**Tradeoffs** — At max\_substeps=1 the sim runs at most one substep per rendered frame, so on a 30 fps machine with a 120 Hz fixed\_dt the sim effectively runs at 30 Hz physics. For dev/stress testing, raising to 4 allows catch-up at the cost of occasional longer frames.

**Code anchors** — `app/crates/fluid-lab/src/timestep.rs → TimestepController::steps_for_frame`; `app/crates/fluid-lab/src/settings/mod.rs → physics.max_substeps`.

**Applies to** — `architecture/app-shell.md`, `architecture/settings.md`.

## Optimize only after profiling; 1M particles is a stretch benchmark

**Decision** — Do not rewrite the solver, buffers, or renderer on intuition — use
profiler data. The exception is obvious architecture risk (no normal-frame readback,
safe buffer layout, safe P2G). 1M particles at 30 FPS is a stretch benchmark to test
once the GPU path is mature, not an MVP design target.

**Why** — This sim has many plausible bottlenecks; blind optimization wastes budget
and can distort the architecture toward a number nobody needs yet.

**Applies to** — `architecture/gpu-resources.md`, `architecture/profiler.md`.
