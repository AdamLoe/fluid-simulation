# Documentation ownership

The canonical owner map — "which one doc owns this concept" — is **structured data**,
not a prose table. It lives at [`_meta/ownership.json`](_meta/ownership.json)
(agent-docs v1, Layer A: concept → owner doc + allowed referencers; no code anchors).

## How to use it

- **Finding an owner:** read `_meta/ownership.json` and match your concept. The `owner`
  field is the one doc you edit; every other doc *links* to it instead of redefining
  the concept.
- **The rule itself** ("edit the owner; non-owners link, never redefine; move drift back
  to the owner") is generic and lives in the global authoring rules
  (`~/.agentdocs/rules/authoring-rules.md`, rule 1), not here.
- **Adding/maintaining owners:** when a concept gets a new canonical owner or a
  cross-doc conflict appears, add/edit an entry in `_meta/ownership.json`.

This file is a thin pointer kept so existing `See also` links resolve. The data is the
JSON; the rules are global.
